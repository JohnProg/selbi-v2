Selbi-v2

This is a second implementation of Selbi based on firebase. This repo contains:

- selbi-backend: Tests covering the firebase schema and demonstrating various actions.
- selbi-stripe-worker: Node service which listens to firebase for stripe updates.

Git Flow
--------
There are 2 branches:
- staging 
- production

All commits should go to the `staging` branch and then be merged in to `production`. CircleCI (not yet implemented) will manage deploying the application.

The services on the production branch are configured via `selbi-backend/.firebaserc` and `firebase-service-accounts/service-account.json` to talk to the selbi-production Firebase instance.

In general, tests interact directly with Firebase and are configured to hit selbi-staging, regardless of the branch.

Running `firebase deploy` from `selbi-backend` will deploy the firebase rules to the specified branch (thanks to .firebaserc). THis is due to 1 extra commit on the production branch which modifies `.firebaserc` and `firebase-service-accounts/service-account.json`.
